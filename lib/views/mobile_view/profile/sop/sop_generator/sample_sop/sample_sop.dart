      '''Since I was a kid, I have always had a screwdriver in my pocket and an urge to
open up everything around me—from clocks to cars—to see what makes it tick.
The idea of ‘creation’ has always fascinated me. The shelves of my room were
filled with the remains of failed experiments. My obsession further reached its
peak, when at the age of 11, my father gave me the extraordinary challenge of
assembling my first ever computer—all from scratch.
Growing up, I always volunteered to be the Computer Science substitute on
every Teacher’s Day celebration. I was nicknamed ‘Cabbage’ by my peers, which
in some way or the other, bothered me initially. But eventually down the line, I
discovered that the so-called ‘slur’ was actually a wordplay corresponding to
‘Babbage'—the creator of the world’s first mechanical computer. From then
onwards, I realised that sometimes mockery can be prestigious. The open-ended
classroom discussions conducted by our experienced faculty and the queries
posed by my juniors, prompted me to research various aspects of this
ever-growing field and engage with it more deeply.
I was able to secure the Zonal Rank 1 in the National Cyber Olympiad conducted
by Science Olympiad Foundation. Further, I was inducted in the official school
quiz team and was part of multiple victorious squads. Later on, I was promoted to
the position of ‘Quiz Mentor’ in 9th grade—it was a huge achievement for me. I
also managed to score a full marks of 100 in my Computer Applications board
exam.
The monstrous phase of lockdown kept me totally suspended both physically and
mentally. The only open door and window which acted as my companion in this
hideous phase—was my laptop. I researched heavily on the internet during this
time and enrolled myself in various courses ranging from Marketing to Web
Development. Eventually, I participated in the Amity Summer School Online in
Computer Science which assisted me in channelizing my interests. I started
posting a lot of content on my LinkedIn account which led me to a paid internship
as a Head of Community at Novaverse Technologies Private Limited, a
career-focused platform for teenagers to connect with like-minded peers. There, I
was instrumental in building a thriving online community of ambitious teenagers,
which attracted 1200+ members in the first week of its launch. Parallelly, I started
creating websites for local businesses on a freelance basis. Eventually two of my
friends joined me on the journey and we soon developed it into a full-fledged web
agency catering to an array of clients.
Attaining financial independence was a huge thing for me, but I still felt that I was
missing the last piece of the puzzle. I was brooding on many matters, suddenly I
realised that it was high time to do something for society. I emanated a voluntary
organisation named ‘Aid For Ed Youth Foundation’ which strives to work towards
the betterment of tomorrow by striking at the root of all major causes—’Lack of
Education’. We initiated projects where we visited a lot of primary schools in the
rural areas. Breaking the stereotypes, we managed to provide them not only
education, food and stationary but also entertainment. This initiation was greatly
accepted and applauded. As a sign of recognition, I was inducted in the Futures
Egalitarian Ethical Liberal Leaders’ list of top 150 changemakers of the
subcontinent.
All these experiences have upskilled and conditioned me for a rigorous course
like Computer Science at a fast-paced setting of a University. I am confident
about my own potential and sure to carve a niche''';
